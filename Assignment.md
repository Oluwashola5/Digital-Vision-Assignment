INTRODUCTION

Purpose

This test plan defines the testing approach and overall framework that will drive the Repository Management web application, ensuring its core functionalities are thoroughly tested to meet business and user requirements. This has been created to facilitate communication within the team members. 

Project Overview

The Repository Management web application allows users to create and manage repositories, track issues, handle pull requests, and manage user roles and permissions.

Key Functionality

-Repository Creation, Editing, and Deletion
-Issue Tracking and Commenting
-Pull Request Workflow
-User Role Management


TEST STRATEGY

Scope

The test will cover both functional and non functional tests:

-Functional Testing (Repository actions, Issue tracking, Pull requests, User roles)
-Regression Testing
-Integration Testing
-UI/UX Testing/Non functional
-Security and Performance Testing

Test Types

Test Type	Description
Functional	Validate core features like repository creation and issue tracking.
Regression	Ensure new updates do not break existing functionality.
Integration	Validate interactions between modules (e.g., repository and pull request)
UI/UX	Verify interface usability and responsiveness.
Security	Test user authentication, authorization, and data protection.
Performance	Assess application speed and load capacity.


Test Environment

-Development: Unit and integration tests.
-Staging: Full test execution with real-like test data.
-Production: Post-release monitoring.


Test Acceptance Criteria 
I.Approved Functional Specification document, Use case documents must be available prior to the start of the test phase.
II.Development completed, unit tested with pass status and results shared to Testing team to avoid duplicate defects
III.Test application installed, configured and ready to use state

AUTOMATION APPROACH

Automated Test Selection

-Critical User Flows (e.g., Repository creation, Issue management)
-Regression Tests to cover frequent changes

Sample Automated Test Script (Cypress - JavaScript)

import {createRepository} from "../../fixtures/selectors.js";

describe('Repository Management Tests', () => {
beforeEach(() => {
//Launch Webapp
        cy.visit('/');

//Login
  cy.get(username).type('testuser');
        cy.get(password).type('securepassword');
        cy.get(submitBtn).click();
        });

//User Logs in to the repository account

    it('should log in successfully', () => {
        cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
        cy.contains('Welcome, testuser').should('be.visible');
    });

//User creates a new repository

    it('should create a new repository successfully', () => {
        cy.contains('New Repository').click();
        cy.get(inputRepoNameFld).type('NewRepo');
        cy.get(createRepoBtn).click();
        
        cy.contains('NewRepo').should('exist');
        cy.get(repoList).should('contain', 'NewRepo');
});

//User creates new issue

 it('should create a new issue successfully', () => {
        cy.contains('NewRepo').click();
        cy.contains('Issues').click();
        cy.contains('New Issue').click();
        
        cy.get(newIssueFld).type('Bug in login functionality');
        cy.get(issueDescFld).type('Login button does not work when clicked.');
        cy.get(submitIssue).click();
        
        cy.contains('Bug in login functionality').should('exist');
    });
});

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

CI/CD Integration

-Automated tests will be triggered on new commits (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
-Reports generated and integrated with bug tracking on Jira.

Regression Testing Strategy

-Automated regression suite will runs before every major deployment
-Focus will be on core functionalities and recent bug fixes

Performance & Security Testing

-Load testing with JMeter to check repository handling under high usage
-Security checks for user authentication and data privacy vulnerabilities

Conclusion

This test plan ensures that the Repository Management application undergoes rigorous testing for reliability, security, and performance. The combination of manual and automated tests will help maintain high-quality standards and seamless CI/CD integration.
